For my capstone at Epicodus, I built a Portland based trip planner with the primary modes being bike and transit. I decided to build this app because at the time of development, Google Maps had not released the feature where the user could query a multimodal trip.

I used the [Trimet Trip Planner API](https://developer.trimet.org/ws_docs/tripplanner_ws.shtml) to find routes, Google Maps API to convert addresses to coordinates, [MapBox](https://uber.github.io/react-map-gl/#/) to display the data, and [Deck.GL](https://deck.gl/#/) to visualize the trip.
