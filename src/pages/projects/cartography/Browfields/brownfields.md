As part of my internship with Metro I am part of the Regional Snapshot team, which produces articles, infographics and maps on the changing Portland region. As part of the 2017 jobs Snapshot, I produced an interactive map of brownfields in the region so that viewers can understand contaminated sites in their neighborhoods.

I collected data from the Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency, weeded out the the unnecessary information, and assembled it beautifully in Carto.
